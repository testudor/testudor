### 👋 Hi there, I'm Jakob a.k.a. testudor!

I'm a university CompSci student and a passionate maker in the electronics and 3D printing world. Check out [this website](https://testudor.me) for my other platforms and my 3D printing projects!

### 👨‍💻 Projects

My most recent project is a base for solderless breadboards which takes variety of extension modules. You can find the main repository [here](https://github.com/testudor/modular-breadboard-base). All parts are released as open hardware!
