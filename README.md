### 👋 Hi there, I'm Jakob a.k.a. testudor!

I'm a graduate CompSci student and a passionate maker (mostly 3D printing and electronics). Check out [this page](https://testudor.me) for my other platforms!

### 👨‍💻 Projects

My most recent project is a base for solderless breadboards which takes variety of extension modules. You can find the main repository [here](https://github.com/testudor/modular-breadboard-base). All parts are released as open hardware! It was also featured on [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/20/tidy-breadboard-uses-banana-bread/).
